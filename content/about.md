I am a software developer living in vibrant Brooklyn, NY. My main focus is developing resilient and scalable cloud-native applications. I mainly use Java to build these applications (with the help of projects like Spring). I love learning, so I'm constantly learning and experimenting with new languages, technologies and techniques. In my free time, I like to [write and record music](http://vipers.nyc).
